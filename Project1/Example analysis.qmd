**Research question:** Whether drinking certain types of milk with certain fat content for regular consumption is associated with obesity or overweight in adults in US.

**Intended audience:** US adults aged 18-80.

**Data source:** This study is a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic cycle[@cdc_nhanes]. NHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data.

**Statistical Analysis:**

Since NHANES provided survey data, certain weights were applied to adjust for the distribution of the population. Missing data was handled using complete case analysis because the dataset was large enough that bias were minimized.

Multivariable logistic regression models will be used to estimate the association between whole milk consumption and the odds of obesity/overweight compared to normal/underweight, respectively. The results will be shown using odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (95%CIs). The first model will only includes exposure variable, and the second model will be adjusted for potential confounding covariables. All statistical analysis was conducted with R 4.2.2.

#### **Result:**

Data description:

The study included 7555 participants without missing exposure status before weighting and 190,923,999 after weighting. The median age (IQR) was 57 (43, 70), 47 (33, 63), 47 (32, 62), 44 (30, 59) and 44 (30, 61) in fat-free, 1%, 2%, whole fat and other milk group. Those who drinks fat-free milk tended to be older, female and non-Hispanic White, with higher education level and income, while those who drinks whole fat milk tended to be younger, male and non-White (mainly non-Hispanic Black), with lower education level and income (Table 1).

#### **Summary**

The results of regression analysis showed that before adjusting for other factors, only drinking whole fat milk was statistically significantly associated with lower risk of obesity or overweight (OR: 0.55, p = 0.007). However, after adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, age, education level, family poverty income ratio, physical activity and energy intake, the association was eliminated (OR: 0.64, p = 0.077). None of the types of milk appeared to have an association with obesity or overweight (Table 2).
