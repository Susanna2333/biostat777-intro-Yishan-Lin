Hi! My name is Yishan Lin. I am not an AI, so I can't show everything about myself to you here, but I am glad to introduce my biography and a little bit about my current thoughts. I hope you will find it interesting and would like to talk with me in person one day!

### Fun things about me

I like animes and one of my favorite is Psycho-Pass, a Japanese anime.
